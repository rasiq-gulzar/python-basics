in the encapsulation in python: 
bundling of data (attriubutes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit.
it capsules the attrubutes and methods of a class into a singel bundel or capsule

Attrubutes: 
common attr:
obj attr:
it has three types: 
1. Private attributes: can be accessed within the class
syntax: 
   fuction(self.__model=model) this is now private
2. protected attrubutes: intended to be used within the class
syntax:
   _
3. Public attributes: 


the special methods like getter()(for access) and setter()(for modification) can be used to access the private 
another way is to use the Name Mangling: pyhton changes the method internally we can access it like 
print(p1._ClassName__attributeName)
